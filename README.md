### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Howdy! I'm Dr. Amanda Martin. My passion is coding for solutions. I use to code for physics and astornomy and now I code for more social problems.
I love working with APIs, making cool scripts or programs, and learning new things. I'm passionate about open source and about sharing what I know with others!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Deephaven](https://github.com/deephaven)
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [gitter](https://gitter.im/deephaven/deephaven) 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I did research astrophysics before moving to teaching, then full time software.
