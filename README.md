### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dr. Amanda Martin. My passion is coding for solutions in the open source realm. No project is to big or small as long as it helps move us forward!

I love working with APIs, making cool scripts or programs, and learning new things. I'm passionate about sharing what I know with others!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle)
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/DrAmandaLMartin/) 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I did research astrophysics before moving to teaching, then full time software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the [Reach DSL](https://github.com/reach-sh/reach-lang) through a Bounty Hack
